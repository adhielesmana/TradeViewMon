Build me a full application with the following features and architecture:

1. Purpose of the App
I want an application that:
* Fetches stock market data from an external API
* Stores historical data for at least 1 year
* Continuously updates real-time prices every 30 seconds or 1 minute
* Generates market projections/predictions using machine learning
* Compares the prediction vs actual price
* Shows the accuracy, match vs not match
* Displays clear charts and tables

2. Data Source (API Integration)
Use a cheap/free market data API such as:
* AllTick API or
* StockData.org API or
* Alpha Vantage API
The app should:
* Pull 1-year historical data (OHLCV if possible)
* Store it in the database
* Run an automatic scheduler to fetch new data every 30 seconds or 1 minute
* Update the database with the new candle

3. Backend Requirements
Backend should include:
* API integration module
* Data ingestion system (scheduled jobs / cron)
* Data cleaner (normalize missing candles, format OHLC)
* Prediction engine (AI/ML model)
* Logging and error handling
Prediction engine should:
* Use a simple but effective model:
    * LSTM
    * GRU
    * Prophet
    * or a regression model
* Predict short-term movement:
    * Next 1 minute
    * Next 5 minutes
* Output:
    * Predicted direction
    * Predicted price
Accuracy comparison system:
Every time the actual price comes in:
* Compare predicted price vs actual price
* Mark:
    * "MATCH" if within threshold (configurable)
    * "NOT MATCH" otherwise
* Store the results for accuracy statistics

4. Database Requirements
You may use:
* PostgreSQL with timestampDB
Must store:
1. Historical market data (1 year)
    * timestamp
    * open, high, low, close
    * volume
2. Real-time update records
3. Predicted values per timestamp
4. Accuracy results comparison
Additional features:
* Auto-merge historical + real-time
* Deduplicate candles
* Keep clean time intervals

5. Frontend Requirements
Web dashboard or mobile app that includes:
Main Screens
1. Live Market Screen
    * Real-time price
    * 1m chart
    * Indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD optional)
2. Prediction Dashboard
    * Prediction chart (line or candle overlay)
    * Table: Timestamp / Predicted / Actual / Result (Match/Not Match)
    * Accuracy percentage
3. Historical Data View
    * 1-year price chart
    * Filters (1D / 1W / 1M / 3M / 6M / 1Y)
4. System Status
    * API health
    * Last update time
    * Scheduler status

6. Scheduler/Daemon
The app must include an automatic updater:
* Runs every 30 seconds or 1 minute
* Fetches latest price candle
* Stores it
* Runs prediction model
* Compares prediction vs actual
* Updates accuracy table

7. Technology Preference
Use any of the following:
* Node.js + Express
* Python FastAPI
* Django + Celery
* React / Next.js
* Flutter for mobile
Prediction model can be built using:
* Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
* OR a built-in ML module

8. Output I Expect
The AI should deliver:
* Backend source code
* Frontend source code
* Database schema
* API integration code
* Scheduler/cron logic
* Prediction model code
* Accuracy comparison logic
* Example .env configuration
* Setup and deployment instructions
